## 🧭 Application Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    T[Teacher portal] --> R[React frontend]
    S[Student scanner] --> R
    R --> API[Spring Boot REST API]
    API --> V[Token, GPS and device validation]
    V --> DB[(Attendance database)]
```

1. The teacher starts a session and the classroom GPS coordinates are saved.
2. The backend generates a UUID-based QR token that refreshes every 15 seconds.
3. The student scans the live QR code from the browser.
4. The frontend sends the token, GPS coordinates, student ID, and device fingerprint to the backend.
5. The backend validates all four conditions:
   - The token exists and has not already been used.
   - The token has not expired within the 20-minute session window.
   - The student is inside the configured radius using the Haversine formula.
   - The device has not already been used during the session.
6. Valid attendance is recorded, while failed attempts are stored in the security-audit log.
7. The teacher dashboard updates the present-student list and audit information in real time.

## 🚀 Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- MySQL 8
- Maven 3.9

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BristiGhosh604/qr-attendance.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the Spring Boot project:

   ```bash
   cd qr-attendance/qr-attendance
   ```

3. Create the MySQL database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE qr_attendance;
   ```

4. Update `application.properties` with your MySQL credentials.

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

6. Open the application:

   ```text
   http://localhost:8080/index.html
   ```

The compiled React frontend is already included inside Spring Boot's static resources, so Node.js is not required to run the repository.

## 🔐 Security Summary

| **Protection** | **Purpose** |
|:---|:---|
| **Dynamic QR token** | Limits the usefulness of copied or outdated QR codes |
| **Single-use validation** | Prevents a token from recording attendance more than once |
| **Token expiration** | Rejects codes outside the active session window |
| **GPS geo-fencing** | Confirms that the student is near the configured classroom location |
| **Device fingerprinting** | Reduces duplicate or proxy attendance from one device |
| **Suspicious-attempt audit** | Records failed verification attempts for teacher review |
